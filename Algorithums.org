* Fundamentals
** Summary of topics
       - You can run algorithms to study their properties
       - You can put them to good use immediately in applications

   - Programming constructs(building blocks), software libraries( programmming concepts),
     and operating systems used to impemet programs make up our
     peogramming model
   - To understand this model let us frist talk about statements
   - Here are the different types of statements:
       - Declarations: reate specific type of variables and name w
         identifiers
       - Assignments: associate data type with variable
       - Conditionals: provide change in execution flow
       - Loops: more profound change in execution flow, repeat block mutiple times
       - Call and returns relate static methods
   - arrays store a sequence of values
      - to initalize an array declare array name and type,create the array
      initalxe the values
      - Defalt values are set to zero, you initalze them through a for loop
   - Static methods: can bel declared without the name of the method, declare class
     name
     - Here's an example static method:
       #+begin_src java
       public static squrt(double c)
       #+end_src
   - properties of methods
     - Methods can be overloaded
     - methods have a single return value but can have mulitple return statements
     - A method can have side effects
   - Recursion: method will call intself
   - External Libraries: imported statements (ex: =java.lang.*=)

** Data Abstraction
   - hello
   - this
   - $e=mc^2$
   - This is displalystyle: $$e=mc^2$$
** Bags, Queues, and Stacks
** Analysis of Algorithms
** Case Study: Union-Find
