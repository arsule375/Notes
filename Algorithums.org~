* Ch 1: Fundamentals
** Summary of topics
   -Algorithums: methods for solving problems that are suited
   for computer implemtation
   -Data Structures: schemes for organizing data to make them solvable for
   Alogrithums
   -basic programming model: small subset of java plus authors owns libraries for
    input/output for statiscal calculations
   -Data abstraction: to remove phsical or spacial properties in data to move virtual
** 1.1: Basic programming model
   -We implement  Algorithums as programs in java because:
       -Our programs are concese, elegant, and complete desciptions
       of algorithums
       -You can run algorithums to study their properties
       -You can put them to good use immediately in applications

   -Programming constructs(building blocks), software libraries( programmming concepts),
     and operating systems used to impemet programs make up our
     peogramming model
   -To understand this model let us frist talk about statements
   -Here are the different types of statements:
       -Declarations: reate specific type of variables and name w
       identifiers
       -Assingments: associate data type with variable
       -Conditionals: provide change in execution flow
       -Loops: more profound change in execution flow, repeat block mutiple times
       -Call and returns relate static methods
   - arrays      - EX: public satic squrt(double c)
   -properties of methods
     -Methods can be overloaded
     -methods have a single return value but can have mulitple return statements
     -A method can have side effects
   - Recursion: method will call intself
   - External Libraries: imported statements (ex: java.lang.*)
